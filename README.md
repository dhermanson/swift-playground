# Swift Playground
This is just a place for me to learn Swift.

## Launch a REPL
To launch a REPL with your library and dependencies loaded, run:
```sh
swift run --repl
```

When inside the REPL, you can import our library:
```swift
import MyLibrary

let d = MyLibrary.Person(name: "derick")
d.say("hello world!")
```
